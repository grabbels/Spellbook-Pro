<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
	I'm so glad you're here. Inky's Spellbook is a project I've been working on on and off now for
	quite some time, and like any "let's see where it goes" project it got completely out of hand and
	it turned into an ambitious plan for a web-app (the one you're on now) and an app for mobile
	devices (next phase).
</p>
<p style="color:var(--red)">DANGER: bugs up ahead</p>
<p>
	Have a look around, but be warned that there might be scary and dangerous bugs lurking around!
	They bite. This app is currently very much in beta, and I would be very thankful if you could
	report any issues or bugs you may encounter. Features requests or ideas are also very welcome!
	You'll find buttons to report bugs and submit spells in the menu. I'd love to hear from you!
</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
